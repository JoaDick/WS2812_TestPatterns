# WS2812 Test Patterns
A little sketch to check the functionality of a WS2812 LED strip with an Arduino.

It shows some color patterns to check the functionality of the LEDs,
and a ruler like pattern for easily counting the total number of LEDs of the strip. \
Change the displayed pattern with a pushbutton connected to pin 2 (and GND). \
Connect the LED strip to pin 6; max. 300 LEDs are addressed by default.

Uses FastLED library for controlling the WS2812 LEDs.
